setup:
    we always run migrations against the last deployed version of the schema.  run the docker-compose.yaml in ./Docker to get it locally
    run the command line (dotnet ef migrations add {name})
    that command line will look at our WellbeingDevContextProvider to retrieve the dbcontext, which is setup to point to your local version of the schema
    migrations are automatically run by host programs
    when you pull down new migrations from other devs, if you need to apply them without running a host, you can use dotnet ef update database

common commands:
    dotnet ef migrations add {name}
    dotnet ef update database
    dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
